# Website creation documentation (Portfolio)

# Scenario base/ Use case

# Description

# Technologies I have used and why?


- Horizontal scaling (Talk about it and the loadBalancer in place) - "Why I have used this"
- LoadBalancer (Why I have used, and showing how it is used)
- Also talk about the use on why I have used this method over Vertical scaling
- AWS provides 3 types of load balancers(Round robin):
+ Application Load Balancer (ALB) - Mostly used in industry

+ Network Load Balancer (NLB)

+ Classic Load Balancers (CLB)
